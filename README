Pan-Latin Keyboard JavaScript App
=================================

(This file contains UTF-8 encoded characters. You may need
to set your terminal locale settings to an appropriate value
in order to view it correctly).

Every bilingual computer user faces the dilemma of having
a keyboard in front of them that is perfect for one of the
languages that they know, but difficult for the other language(s)
they know. Virtual keyboard UIs, Microsoft Alt+codes, and copying-
and-pasting from typeit.org are fine stop-gap measures if you only
need to write a foreign character every once in a while. But 
these methods are all difficult to use for serious 
multi-lingual content creation.

The Pan-Latin keyboard application is an attempt to solve
this problem, at least for a good chunk of those languages 
that are based on the Latin alphabet.

This application attaches behavior to an HTML textarea or
other text input element so that some simple letter-digit
keyboard combos will render a character with an accent
or other special character. This way, someone sitting
at an en-US keyboard can still type their è's, ñ's,
and ß's without too much trouble.

Each digit from 1 to 9 is associated with one or more
diacritical marks. When one of these digits is typed
after a letter, this app may replace the previous character
with another character that has a diacritical mark.
Here are the meanings of each digit,
and the set of extended-Latin characters that you can
type with this class

    1 - acute                áćéíĺńóśúẃýźÁĆÉÍĹŃÓŚÚẂÝŹ
    2 - grave                àèìòùẁỳÀÈÌÒÙẀỲ
    3 - diaeresis            äëïöüẅÿÄËÏÖÜẄŸ
      - horizontal stroke    đħłĐĦŁ
    4 - circumflex           äĉêĝĥîĵôûŝŵŷÂĈÊĜĤÎĴÔÛŜŴŶ
    5 - breve                ăğŭĂĞŬ
        caron                čďěľňřšťžČĎĚĽŇŘŠŤŽ
        diagonal stroke      øØ
    6 - tilde                ãĩñõũÃĨÑÕŨ
    7 - ring above           åůÅŮ
        dot above            ċėġṅżĊĖĠİṄŻ
    8 - ogonek               ąęįųĄĘĮŲ
        cedilla              çģķļņşÇĢĶĻŅŞ
    9 - "special"            æðœßþÆÐŒẞÞ¿¡«»
    
    0 can be used to "clear" a mark. 

             e + 3  ==>  ë ,  ë + 0  ==>  e

      and also to make the Turkish dotless i:  i + 0 ==>  ı

   11 - double acute          őű
   22 - macron                āēīōūĀĒĪŌŪ

USAGE

Include the source from the enclosed  panlatinkb.js
file in your HTML file. Using jQuery or other 
appropriate JavaScript, invoke the function
plkeyboard_init  on a  textarea  or other text input
element:

    <script type="text/javascript" 
        src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js">
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src=".../panlatinkb.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $('textarea, input[type="text"]').each( function() {
            $(this).attr("plkb-mode", "all");
            init_plkeyboard( $(this) );
        } );
    </script>

The attribute "plkb-mode" on the textarea or input element
can customize the behavior of this script. The default mode
is "all", which makes key combinations for all supported
languages available. But you can change this value so that
the app will only produce the characters for one particular
language. See the available choices for this value in
panlatinkb-map.js .

Your HTML file should be encoding for displaying unicode
characters (for example, it should have a line like

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

in the <head></head> section), or else 



SUPPORT/FEEDBACK

Please send feedback or feature requests to  
mobrule@gmail.com . I'm particularly interested
in hearing whether the set of characters supported
by this application is good enough for you and
if the configuration of key combinations is 
convenient enough and easy enough to learn.
