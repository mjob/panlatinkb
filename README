Pan-Latin Keyboard JavaScript App
=================================

Every bilingual computer user faces the dilemma of having
a keyboard in front of them that is perfect for one of the
languages that they know, but bad for the other language(s)
they know. The Pan-Latin keyboard class is an attempt
to solve this problem, at least for a good chunk of those
languages that use the Latin alphabet.

This script attaches behavior to an HTML textarea or
other text input element. This way, someone sitting
at an en-US keyboard can still type their é's, ñ's,
and ß's without too much trouble.

Each digit from 1 to 9 is associated with one or more
diacritical marks. Here are the meanings of each digit,
and the set of extended-Latin characters that you can
type with this class

    1 - acute                áćéíĺńóśúẃýźÁĆÉÍĹŃÓŚÚẂÝŹ
    2 - grave                àèìòùẁỳÀÈÌÒÙẀỲ
    3 - diaeresis            äëïöüẅÿÄËÏÖÜẄŸ
      - horizontal stroke    đħłĐĦŁ
    4 - circumflex           äĉêĝĥîĵôûŝŵŷÂĈÊĜĤÎĴÔÛŜŴŶ
    5 - breve                ăğŭĂĞŬ
        caron                čďěľňřšťžČĎĚĽŇŘŠŤŽ
        diagonal stroke      øØ
    6 - tilde                ãĩñõũÃĨÑÕŨ
    7 - ring above           åůÅŮ
        dot above            ċėġṅżĊĖĠİṄŻ
    8 - ogonek               ąęįųĄĘĮŲ
        cedilla              çģķļņşÇĢĶĻŅŞ
    9 - "special"            æðœßþÆÐŒẞÞ¿¡«»
    
    0 can be used to "clear" a mark. 

             e + 3  ==>  ë ,  ë + 0  ==>  e

      and also to make the Turkish dotless i:  ı

   11 - double acute          őű
   22 - macron                āēīōūĀĒĪŌŪ

These characters should be sufficient for all your typing
needs for many languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, 
German,  French, Turkish, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Dutch,
Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Hungarian, Catalan, Czech,
Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Slovak, Afrikaans, Norwegian,
and many others.
